# End-to-End-CNN-Audio-Classifier-with-Real-Time-Dashboard-

In this project the developed model will classify sounds like a dog barking or birds chirping from an audio file. Advanced techniques like Residual Networks (ResNet), data mixing, and Mel Spectrograms to build a robust training pipeline. Made a dashboard using Next.js and React to upload audio and visualize the model's internal layers to see what it "sees". The project uses Python, PyTorch, Next.js, React, and Tailwind, based on the T3 Stack.
